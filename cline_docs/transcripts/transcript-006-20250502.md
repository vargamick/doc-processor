## Development Log

### 2025-05-02: Component Verification

1. Database Schema Verification
   - Confirmed proper implementation of three main tables:
     * documents: Stores document metadata and content
     * processing_statuses: Tracks document processing state
     * embeddings: Stores vector embeddings with pgvector
   - Verified proper foreign key relationships
   - Confirmed pgvector extension integration
   - Schema supports all required metadata fields

2. Document Processing Pipeline Verification
   - Confirmed implementation of BaseDocumentProcessor with:
     * Modular text extraction
     * Metadata extraction
     * Chunk generation with configurable size/overlap
     * Error handling and retry mechanisms
   - ProcessorFactory properly supports:
     * PDF documents
     * DOCX documents
     * Extensible design for new formats

3. Text Processing Utilities Verification
   - Confirmed implementation of core functions:
     * Text chunking with overlap
     * Language detection
     * Keyword extraction
     * Word counting
     * Text cleaning and normalization
   - NLTK integration properly configured
   - Performance measurement decorators in place

4. Embedding System Verification
   - Verified EmbeddingProcessor implementation:
     * Sentence transformer integration
     * Batch processing support
     * Redis caching capability
     * Type-safe tensor operations
     * Proper device handling (CPU/GPU)
   - Default model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   - Configurable batch size and sequence length

## Technical Decisions

1. Database Design
   - PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector operations
   - JSONB for flexible metadata storage
   - Proper timestamp tracking
   - Status tracking for processing pipeline

2. Processing Pipeline
   - Modular processor design
   - Factory pattern for processor selection
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Performance monitoring

3. Embedding System
   - Sentence transformers for embedding generation
   - Redis for caching
   - Type-safe implementation
   - Batch processing optimization
