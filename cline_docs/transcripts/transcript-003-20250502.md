- Set up environment variables
- Create integration tests

### 3. Resource Configuration
- Define resource limits
- Configure container resources
- Implement monitoring

## Success Criteria

1. Health Checks
   - [ ] All services have implemented health check endpoints
   - [ ] Docker containers have health check configurations
   - [ ] Health monitoring is operational

2. Service Communication
   - [ ] Services can communicate using Docker network aliases
   - [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
   - [ ] Integration tests pass successfully

3. Documentation
   - [ ] Environment variables documented
   - [ ] Network configuration documented
   - [ ] Resource allocation documented

## Step-by-Step Actions

1. Health Check Implementation
   ```bash
   # Verify each service endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Backend
   curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Parser
   curl http://localhost:3000/health  # Frontend
   ```

2. Docker Configuration
   ```bash
   # Validate container health
   docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}"
   
   # Check network configuration
   docker network ls
   docker network inspect doc-processor_default
   ```

3. Integration Testing
   ```bash
   # Test inter-service communication
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test/parser-communication
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test/database-communication
   ```

### Implementation Details

1. Health Check Enhancements:
   ```python
   # Backend health check now verifies:
   - Database connectivity
   - Parser service availability
   
   # Parser health check now verifies:
   - Tesseract installation
   - Poppler functionality
   - Storage access
   ```

2. Docker Configuration Updates:
   ```yaml
   # Resource limits example:
   deploy:
     resources:
       limits:
         cpus: "0.50"
         memory: 512M
       reservations:
         cpus: "0.25"
         memory: 256M
   ```

3. Network Configuration:
   ```yaml
   networks:
     default:
       driver: bridge
       ipam:
         config:
           - subnet: 172.28.0.0/16
   ```

4. Service Discovery:
   - Services can now communicate using Docker DNS names
   - Backend connects to parser using http://parser:8001
   - All services on same bridge network

5. Integration Testing:
   ```bash
   # Run integration tests
   python backend/test_integration.py
   
   # Test verifies:
   - Health check endpoints
   - Inter-service communication
   - Document processing flow
   ```

### Notes
- Implementation follows Docker best practices
- Focus on robust error handling
- Emphasis on monitoring and observability
