# Process Optimisation Log

## Development Environment Setup (2025-05-02)

### Performance Improvements Implemented
1. VS Code Workspace Configuration
   - Multi-root workspace with organized service folders
   - Comprehensive debug configurations for all services
   - Compound launch configuration for full-stack debugging
   - Standardized editor settings across services

2. Development Tools Integration
   - Code formatting: Black (Python), Prettier (TypeScript/JavaScript)
   - Linting: ESLint, Pylint
   - Type checking: TypeScript, Python type hints
   - Path intellisense for improved navigation
   - Git integration with recommended extensions

### Workflow Enhancements Implemented
1. Project Structure
   - Modular microservices architecture
   - Clear separation of concerns:
     * Backend (FastAPI)
     * Frontend (React/TypeScript)
     * Parser Service
     * Infrastructure (Docker/Nginx)
   - Consistent directory structure across services

2. Documentation System
   - Centralized documentation in cline_docs/
   - Standardized markdown templates
   - Automated transcript generation
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Clear task management

3. VS Code Integration
   - Custom extension recommendations
   - Standardized editor settings
   - Integrated testing configurations

### Documentation Improvements
1. Comprehensive Documentation Set
   - Project roadmap with detailed milestones and sub-tasks
   - Technology stack with version specifications
   - Detailed architecture and codebase documentation
   - Real-time task tracking and progress updates
   - Process optimization logging

2. Development Guides
   - VS Code workspace setup
   - Debug configuration guide
   - Environment setup instructions

## Optimization Insights

### Implemented Optimizations
1. Development Environment
   - Containerized development setup (pending)
   - Hot-reloading for all services
   - Integrated debugging across stack
   - Standardized code formatting

2. Code Quality
   - Automated formatting on save
   - Consistent code style enforcement
   - Type checking configuration

3. Testing Strategy
   - Configured test runners
   - Debug configurations for tests
   - Separate test databases

### Planned Optimizations
1. Performance
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching implementation
   - Service worker configuration
   - Vector search optimization

2. Development Workflow
   - Add pre-commit hooks
   - Implement automated testing
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

3. Monitoring
   - Add logging configuration
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Set up error tracking

## Notes and Metrics
- Environment setup time reduced through standardized configuration
- Development workflow streamlined with integrated tools
- Documentation maintenance simplified through centralization
- Next focus: Service implementation and containerization
- Metrics to track:
  * Build times
  * Development iteration speed
  * Code quality scores
  * Test coverage
