# Codebase Summary

## Database Structure
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector operations
- SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic migrations
- ChromaDB for vector storage and similarity search
- ArangoDB for knowledge graph storage

    * meetings: Meeting metadata and scheduling
    * policies: Policy documents and review requirements
    * roles: Role definitions and responsibilities
    * standing_items: Regular review items
  - Edge collections:
    * reviewed_at: Links documents to review meetings
